#a function allows us to bundle code into 
#reusable blocks, making it easier to understand.
#By defining functions, we can 
#avoid code duplication and enhance readability

    #refactoring means to 
    #restructure code without 
    #changing its external behavior 
    #This helps improve code reliability 
    #and maintainability 




    # Problem Set 1: Indexing and Slicing Strings
    # Basic Indexing:
    # Given the string magic = 'abracadabra',
    # a. Retrieve the 5th character.
    magic = 'abracadabra'
    print(magic[4])
    # b. Retrieve the second to last character.
    print(magic[9])
    # c. Find the first occurrence of the letter 'c'.
    print(magic[4])
